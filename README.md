# Memorio

Memorio is a memory allocation simulator developed educationally to assist with learning the two different allocation methods: static and dynamic.
In this web app, users can create partitions and programs, start the simulation and gather interesting data.
This template provides a minimal setup to get React working in Vite with HMR and some ESLint rules.

Memorio is currently hosted in https://memorio-chi.vercel.app and is an ongoing project.

## Setting up

To start running the app locally, clone the repository, then run
```
npm install
```
After all the dependencies are installed, start the local server by running
```
npm run dev
```
Have fun!
